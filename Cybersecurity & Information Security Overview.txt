Computer Fundamentals
---------------------
Understanding Computers:
- A computer is an electronic device that processes input to generate output.
- Origin: The Greek word "compute" means "to calculate."
- Charles Babbage is considered the "Father of Modern Computers."
- Computers operate using binary (0,1):
  - 0 = OFF
  - 1 = ON

Storage & Number Systems:
- Storage Basics:
  - 1 Byte = 8 Bits
  - 1 KB = 1024 Bytes
  - 1 MB = 1024 KB
  - 1 GB = 1024 MB
  - 1 TB = 1024 GB
  - 1 PB = 1024 TB

- Number Systems:
  - Decimal (Base 10): 0–9
  - Binary (Base 2): 0,1
  - Octal (Base 8): 0–7
  - Hexadecimal (Base 16): 0–9, A–F

Characteristics of Computers:
1. Speed: Measured in hertz (Hz) – oscillations per second.
2. Storage: Defined by bytes, nibbles, and partitions.
3. Diligence: Computers do not get tired or refuse to operate.
4. Accuracy: High precision in computations.

Computer Generations
--------------------
1st Generation (1946-1959): Vacuum tubes (e.g., ENIAC).
2nd Generation (1959-1965): Transistors (e.g., IBM machines).
3rd Generation (1965-1971): Integrated Circuits (ICs).
4th Generation (1972-2010): Microprocessors (Microsoft, Apple, Google).
5th Generation (2010–Present): AI-driven computing (i3, i5, i7).

Networking (N+)
--------------
Network Basics:
- A network is a connection between two or more devices for communication and resource sharing.
- Types of Networks:
  - LAN (Local Area Network) – Small geographical area (office, lab).
  - WAN (Wide Area Network) – Large-scale networking (Internet, ISP-based).
  - MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) – City-wide connectivity.

Network Topologies:
- Bus – Simple, cost-effective, but network failure if cable is damaged.
- Ring – Data flows in a circular fashion, reliable but not scalable.
- Star – Centralized hub, easy troubleshooting, but costly.
- Tree – Hybrid of bus & star, scalable but complex.
- Mesh – Each device connects to every other, reliable but expensive.
- Hybrid – Combination of multiple topologies, flexible but difficult to manage.

Network Devices:
- NIC (Network Interface Card): Provides network connectivity.
- Repeater: Amplifies signals for long-distance transmission.
- Hub & Switch: Connects multiple devices in a network.
- Router: Manages network traffic, creates routing tables.
- Modem: Converts analog signals to digital and vice versa.
- Firewall: Secures network from unauthorized access.

IP Addressing & Subnetting
-------------------------
Types of IP Addresses:
- Public IP – Used for internet access, assigned by ISPs.
- Private IP – Used within local networks (LAN).

IP Address Classes:
Class A: 0.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255 (Large networks)
Class B: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 (Medium networks)
Class C: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 (Small networks)
Class D: 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 (Multicasting)
Class E: 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 (Research)

Subnet Mask & CIDR:
- Subnet Mask: Defines network vs. host portion.
- CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing): Notation like /24 specifies subnet size.

IPv4 vs. IPv6:
- IPv4: 32-bit, limited address space.
- IPv6: 128-bit, uses hexadecimal notation, supports auto-configuration.

Ports & Protocols:
- Well-Known Ports (0-1023):
  - HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) – Web services.
  - DNS (53) – Domain Name System.
  - FTP (20,21) – File Transfer Protocol.
  - SSH (22) – Secure Shell for remote login.
  - SMTP (25), POP3 (110), IMAP (143) – Email protocols.

Transport Protocols:
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – Reliable, connection-oriented.
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – Fast, connectionless, used in DNS/DHCP.

Computer Hardware Components:
- Storage Devices:
  - HDD (Hard Disk Drive) – Traditional, mechanical storage.
  - SSD (Solid State Drive) – Faster, uses flash memory.
  - External Storage – USB drives, wireless HDDs.

- Motherboard Components:
  - CPU Socket – Holds the processor.
  - RAM Slots – For system memory.
  - BIOS/ROM – Stores firmware settings.
  - CMOS Battery – Maintains BIOS settings.
  - SATA/PATA Ports – Connect HDD/SSD drives.
  - Power Connector – Supplies power to the system.
  - PCI Slots – Used for expansion cards.

- Input/Output Devices:
  - Input: Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Joystick.
  - Output: Monitor, Printer, Speaker.
  - Ports:
    - USB – Universal connectivity.
    - HDMI – High-definition video output.
    - LAN (Ethernet) – Wired networking.
    - PS2 – Legacy mouse/keyboard connection.

Booting Process:
1. Power-On – CPU initializes BIOS.
2. POST (Power-On Self-Test) – Hardware diagnostics.
3. OS Boot Process – BIOS loads OS from HDD via MBR.
4. Loading System Files – OS loads necessary components into RAM.
